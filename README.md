# WTWR (What to Wear?): Back End (Server Development)
This is the updated version of the Backend project for the WTWR app. This now features authorization features such as not being able to remove other user's cards, needing a email and password to register as well as anti-duplication features. This update
also features a hash to encrypt passwords thanks to the `bcrypt.js` library. This server was made using `MongoDB` with the `Mongoose` library to connect the two to JS. This also now implements more secure features such as `CORS` and `Helmet`. 
## Launching the server
`npm run start` — to launch the server 

`npm run dev` — to launch the server with the hot reload feature
